            This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.
        </li>
        <li>
            You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and wait 2 hours without opening the door. When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature! This is critical in order for the math to work!

            Serve your prime rib with Chef John's Beef Au Jus or Prime Rib Gravy and Homemade Horseradish Sauce.
